Wrote this quite a long time ago now. The Force Directed bit of it comes from a Aussie by the name of Dennis Hotson. His elegantly written code has been bastardized by me quite extensively but fundamentally its his work. I coded the rest of this. Bear in mind , I wrote this 9 or 10 years ago knowing nothing about graphics programming. Javascript has moved on quite a lot since then. 

Currently working on a new version of this in my Mayflower Mews site(as of Jan 2022).

You can build this using Parcel. Clone the code and from command prompt in JSVisualizers folder run.

Parcel main.html

* I tested this recently the mouse events don't seem to work when dragging the diagrams around. If for some reason you get this far and want to play with it. You might have to wait until the new version arrives in a few months for a more reliable experience!
